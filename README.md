# covid19_korea
This is an EDA of COVID-19 data from South Korea in 2020. 

This was a final team project in university.
We looked at COVID-19 data available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mehmetbicici/south-korea-covid19-analysis/data)

As part of the analysis we explored three aspects:
1. How strong is the correlation between the number of residents in a city to the number of cases (by looking at the capital as a case study)
2. How effective strict immigration policies were at stopping cases from coming from oversees
3. How effective domestic policies were at stopping the spread of the virus between regions
